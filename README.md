Project Overview
----------------
This project demonstrates a modular and scalable machine learning pipeline. It includes:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, categorical encoding, scaling, and custom transformations.
- **Feature Engineering:** Custom transformers for feature construction and transformations.
- **Model Training:** Includes models such as Linear Regression and Decision Tree.
- **Evaluation and Tuning:** Provides cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization.

Installation
------------
To install and set up the required dependencies, use Python 3.7 or later. Run:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Make sure to have `scikit-learn` and other dependencies installed as listed in `requirements.txt`.

Project Structure
-----------------
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration and prototyping.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for running different parts of the pipeline.
- `models/`: Stores trained models and results.
- `config/`: Configuration files for model settings.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing all dependencies.
- `README.txt`: This README file.

Usage
-----
1. **Prepare Data**
   - Ensure your dataset is available in the `data/` directory, or update paths in the configuration files.

2. **Run the Pipeline**
   - Execute the entire pipeline using `main.py` script or run the steps individually in a notebook.
   Example:
       python scripts/main.py

3. **Train and Evaluate Models**
   - The pipeline includes multiple models wrapped in a `Pipeline` structure to streamline feature transformations and model training.
   - Modify models or parameters in the configuration files located in `config/model_config.yaml`.

Configuration
-------------
All configuration files for the pipeline steps, model parameters, and data paths are located in `config/`. Update settings in `model_config.yaml` to customize model hyperparameters, pipeline steps, and evaluation metrics.

Data
----
Place your dataset in the `data/` directory. The dataset should include features such as `total_bedrooms`, `total_rooms`, and `population`. Specify the path in configuration files or notebooks as required.

Results
-------
Trained models and evaluation metrics are saved in the `models/` directory. Results can be customized to save in additional formats if needed.

Contributing
------------
Contributions are welcome. Fork this repository and submit a pull request with your changes. Ensure your code follows existing styles and is well-documented.
